            Hi! My name is Jordan Rivas, I am a senior Computer Science major
            with a specialization in Software Engineering. I currently work a
            part-time job coding for a locksmithing company in Hicksville using
            the Legacy system Qantel. I mainly handled creating several forums
            that allow the user to input different types of information
            regarding invoices, truck maintenance, tax information, etc. I made
            sure the test data was correct and well maintained and collaborated
            with groups to debug and create code. Through this job I gained
            proficiency in Front End / Back End development and maintenance.
            Managing, writing, debugging SQL databases. I also have personal
            experience coding 3D various perspective games on Unity and BlueJ.
